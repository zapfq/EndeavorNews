                            </h5>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought indelible wounds to Malaysia and all countries. As the pandemic
                        spread, people were isolated, lost their jobs, and the country's economy collapsed. In the
                        absence of tourists, Malaysia's tourism industry has suffered from the Movement Control Order
                        (MCO) of the country.
                    </p>

                    <p> The damage the pandemic has done to Malaysia's tourism industry is huge. First, there has been a
                        sharp reduction in the number of flights, the medium by which tourists are introduced. Most of
                        Malaysia's tourists come from nearby countries, such as Singapore, Vietnam, and further afield,
                        China. China has strict quarantine policies and strict controls on people and foreign travellers
                        entering and leaving the country. As a result, the number of visitors to Malaysia has decreased
                        with the reduction in the number of flights, which will affect Malaysia's tourism industry.
                        Fewer flights are also affecting workers in that field. The travel ban has cost airlines money,
                        and employees are constantly at risk of pay cuts and layoffs.
                    </p>

                    <p>Second is the impact of the hotel industry. The Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) disclosed
                        that with the pandemic outbreak, it has received 95,972 bookingsâ€™ total cancellations.
                    </p>

                    <p>It's not just MAH that's been hit hard. Hotels across the country cancelled 170,000 rooms in
                        2020, and the hotel industry is estimated to have lost nearly 70 million ringgit. This will
                        continue until the end of MCO. Among those directly affected are hotel workers who rely on
                        serving tourists. The hotel's losses have led to them being asked to take unpaid leave that will
                        never end, and they are facing layoffs.
                    </p>

                    <p>Malaysia lost an unimaginable amount in tourism in 2020 alone. This hit our economy hard, and it
                        will be two years before the official recovery from MCO takes place in 2022. As a result,
                        Malaysia's economy is still not regaining its former excellence. The economic crackdown has
                        caused prices to rise and people to live hard, but this is another step that cannot be avoided
                        in the fight against the virus.
                    </p>

                    <p>Foreigners have begun to visit Malaysia, and flights have resumed. Malaysia and its people are
                        stronger than expected and stronger than the virus. Although our lives have been affected by the
                        pandemic, it has not knocked down the tourism industry, which has survived challenging times and
                        will get back on track again.
                    </p>
