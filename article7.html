                    <p>
                        <b>KUALA LUMPUR:</b> ESL One Genting 2022 Esports Competition concluded on the night of 28th
                        August while being the 3rd global Esports event hosted by the Genting Organisation and the first
                        since the pandemic started in 2019. (The Star, 2022)
                    </p>

                    <p>What is Esports exactly? It is a competition based on video games. These competitions are
                        broadcasted on stream and watched by millions. Interviews were conducted to get more insight
                        into youth's perspectives on Esports. (CNN, 2018)
                    </p>

                    <p>When asked whether they know about Esports, Shivendra Kogulsash, a University Malaya student and
                        beginner Esports player, stated that Esports are a group of players who have been training
                        together for a long time to compete in a competition to win cash prizes.
                    </p>

                    <p>While another student, Yong Wen Zhuo, a software engineering student from Asia Pacific College
                        and an avid Esports player, seems to have a slightly different view on Esports by stating they
                        are "Tryhards."
                    </p>

                    <p>"Tryhards means they are spending the entire day playing the game, that's how they get good,
                        while I only play for relaxation." Yong said.
                    </p>

                    <p>Both students have a good view of Esports as a career because as long as the players are good,
                        they should go for it, while casual players seem to be an entirely different story.
                    </p>

                    <p>"For youth, I think it's okay for them to play Esports if they want to take this as a career, but
                        they have to put a lot of effort, they have to leave their studies behind and make a lot of
                        sacrifices." Yong said.
                    </p>

                    <p>Students have agreed that Esports is a high-risk, high-reward sport where the more effort you put
                        in, the more you get, but it is important to note only five players out of millions are chosen
                        to be on a professional team.
                    </p>

                    <p>When asked if Esports are comparable to real sports such as the NBA, while both are now commonly
                        considered sports, one is still relatively new on the market while the other is
                        well-established, so only time can tell.
                    </p>

                    <p>"The NBA started very very long ago, and the same goes for football. They've been doing this for
                        a long time and it has become a trend according to generation. If your parents support that then
                        you are naturally bound to get into it but esports starts from our generation. We can see 20
                        years from now and see how it progresses." Shivendra said.
                    </p>

                    <p>Students are relatively conserved about choosing Esports over a real job because you only win big
                        money when you win big tournaments and sponsorship, but if the game dies in five to ten years,
                        you lose your income. "Basically there is no guarantee when you wanna join Esports, either you
                        go broke or go rich." Yong said.
                    </p>

                    <p>It is important to note that players who go for Esports get money from sponsorships and
                        streaming, where they can make a name for themself outside of the Esports circuit.
