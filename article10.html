                                protagonist and the darkness of society that pains the audience; there are many people
                                like Sohara who are suffering in reality.</h5>

                    <p>
                        Hope (Sowon) is a Korean film released in 2013. The movie is based on the kidnapping of Cho
                        Doo-soon in Korea in 2008. This is a story about victims of child sexual violence and their
                        families desperate to heal their wounds.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is a very real, moving, tear-jerker film, it is based on a real case, it left a deep
                        impression on the audience. It is not only the suffering of the protagonist and the darkness of
                        society that pains the audience; there are many people like Sohara who are suffering in reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>It is difficult to describe and express the overwhelming feeling of watching this film. Good men
                        are always on the wrong side of laws that are supposed to be just and fair. Suhara is a
                        beautiful and kind girl, people say that a good deed will be rewarded, but Suhara's kindness
                        hurt her life. Just because she was alone on her way to school and couldn't bear to see a
                        strange uncle in the heavy rain.
                    </p>

                    <p>Infuriating, the reporter in the film forced his way into a hospital room and tried to interview
                        a badly traumatised girl in order to get a first-hand story. That group of journalists
                        completely lacked the professionalism expected of qualified journalists.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since the film aired, many people have been talking about Sowon's case. No one can imagine what
                        was going through the mind of a little girl like that when she was subjected to the worst malice
                        in the world. While the perpetrator is pleading his innocence, the victim is reflecting on what
                        went wrong. Is it wrong to want to help the uncle, or is it because she's wearing a dress today?
                    </p>

                    <p>Sowon asked, "Did I do something wrong? Uncle asked me to give him an umbrella, I would have just
                        walked away, but I thought I should give uncle an umbrella, so I did. But people say it's my
                        fault. No one praises me."
                    </p>

                    <p>The child is taught to help others when they need help, but no one tells her that people with
                        malicious intentions will hurt her. That naive and hurt tone, in an instant, made all the women
                        empathise. It is no longer a matter of days that women are abused.
                    </p>

                    <p>This happened not only to Sowon, but also to many ordinary days and nights. Hence, many women
                        feel helpless after watching this movie, because the reality has reminded us with many bloody
                        cases: hell is empty, the devil is on earth.
                    </p>

                    <p>"Sowon case", "bus rape in India", "Didi driver rape in China"... Too many, and women can only
                        cry out of fear. The victim did something wrong, but malice is always unprovoked, and so is
                        being hurt by others. But fortunately, film directors are trying to convey human warmth. Using
                        the name "Hope" as his film title, the film also shows how Sowon's family perseveres through
                        life's darkest moments.
                    </p>

                    <p>Never let a child be afraid to wear a floral dress. Laws should be enforced strongly on those who
                        prey on the weak. Yes indeed, even within civilised society, we are still following the rules of
                        mother nature. In places where laws fail, fear should take its place. Making those perpetrators
                        afraid to commit their deeds by punishing them with a heavy price on the courtroom, donâ€™t even
                        give them a chance to breathe thinking they can walk out of there in one piece.
                    </p>
